# A simple AWS shell

This is a simple shell for AWS using the great boto library. 

## Authentication

Just like boto itself, you can use the environment variables `AMAZON\_ACCESS\_KEY\_ID` and `AMAZON\_SECRET\_KEY` to set your account authentication. Or you can set/change the keys in boto-shell:

    boto > access_key [key]
    boto > secret_key [key]

## Subshells

To act on things like EC2 or Route53, you can either enter the "subshell" or enter the command directly. For instance:

    boto > route53 zones

Will enter the route53 subshell and run the `zones` command. Or:

    boto > route53
    route53 > 

## List Route53 zones

    boto > route53
    route53 > zones
    ...

## List records in a Route53 zone

    boto > route53 zones
    ...
    route53 > zone [id]
    route53 > list
    ...
